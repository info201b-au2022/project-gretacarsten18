### First Visualization
```{r}
# Chart 1: Gun Violence over the years (2017-2021)
source("../source/chart1.R")
```

We chose to do this type of plot for the first visualization because this plot shows the numbers of the victims over the 12 months from 2017-2021. This data was collected from one of our datasets. The trend represents that over the 5 years, the numbers of victims stayed around the same and slightly increasing as the years go on. Noticeably, the highest amount of victims accounted for were in the years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 all ranging from 100-125. There is no distinct trend of decrease which means that over the course of the years gun-violence from police stayed the same.

### Second Visualization
```{r}
# Chart 2: Number of victims to Gun Violence by Month from 2017-2022
source("../source/chart2.R")
```
Our second visualization of the number of victims total of each month from each year from 2017-2022. This ranges from 0 - 600 number of deaths. To support our claim of non signifcant changes in police brutality, this graph shows that monthly numbers are around the same and when added all up the number of deaths total are also ranging from 400 - 600. Noticeably in this visualization, March has the highest amount of total deaths in the 6 years of recorded data and moving to September to December the death count is lower. In our dataset, for the last three months of the year no deaths were recorded which count be contributing to the lower rates in September to December months.

DYNAMIC PARAGRAPH
In the datasets we've gathered for our project we've gotten information from number of people shot to death by the police in the United States from 2017 to 2022, specifically by race. Another source by the same source, but by month. Lasty, we have a source from the Washington Post about 7902 people have been shot and killed by police since Jan 1, 2015. In our project we've categorized our data sets on many people were killed by police by, month, by month, and in general over a certain amount of years. With the dataset that represented number of people shot to death by police, by month, it gave us data for every month for 6 years. For each month it showed how many documented deaths that were at the hands of the police. For our second dataset, it gave us the name, the date, the manner of death, place, and a lot more. It even pinpointed the exact location of where they were shot and killed. Lastly, our 3rd dataset showed us how many people were killed by police, by race. Race has been a significant attribute on police shootings/killings. The set gives us information on which race has been killed the most and least.
