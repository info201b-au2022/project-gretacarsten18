## ABOUT THIS FILE:

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
`''

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

DYNAMIC PARAGRAPH
In the datasets we've gathered for our project we've gotten information from number of people shot to death by the police in the United States from 2017 to 2022, specifically by race. Another source by the same source, but by month. Lasty, we have a source from the Washington Post about 7902 people have been shot and killed by police since Jan 1, 2015. In our project we've categorized our data sets on many people were killed by police by, month, by month, and in general over a certain amount of years. With the dataset that represented number of people shot to death by police, by month, it gave us data for every month for 6 years. For each month it showed how many documented deaths that were at the hands of the police. For our second dataset, it gave us the name, the date, the manner of death, place, and a lot more. It even pinpointed the exact location of where they were shot and killed. Lastly, our 3rd dataset showed us how many people were killed by police, by race. Race has been a significant attribute on police shootings/killings. The set gives us information on which race has been killed the most and least.
